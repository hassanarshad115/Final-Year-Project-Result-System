Final Year Project Result System 
  </h1>
  #What is Result System? Result System is a final year project, I am working on with two another friends. #Abstract In current education system, students and teachers are only connected during college times, while rest of the time, they rarely have communication regarding education. Thus, study becomes limited to the college hours. When we consider study, especially engineering and technical fields, it converges more towards research than towards formal textbook studies. And when we are considering such scenario, students will surely need guidance from various faculties and bugging them personally over phone would look awkward. Currently, Social Networking has caught the trend and almost all the young generation is using Social Networking but more towards fun and entertainment. This system, eduConnect, adopts the idea to build a new system which will be similar however different. This concept will be used but it will still be education oriented, but not eliminating the entertainment of Social Media. eduConnect will be a web-based system which will virtually map all the entities in real world University. All objects of University, say College, Departments, Classrooms etc will have their existence virtually in this system. Students, Faculties, Principal, etc persons will also be the user of this sytem. So, ultimately, all objects in eduConnect will have existence in real world also. Using this system, any person who is a part of this system will be able to communicate with each other. They can Talk, Chat, discuss and share information in Forums, communicate using Private Messaging, join groups, etc. Thus, this system will become a media for all education related entities stay in touch will each other anytime, share information and communicate.

#Features

#Software Requirement Specification SRS can be found under /SRS.pdf which is very inconsistent and made in urgency for the sake of submitting it to college so that we can have our project selected. It is very inconsistent and almost useless but could be used as a reference for knowing what this system will do.

#Collaboration If you like to collaborate with the project, please comment. All nice features or suggestions are highly welcomed.
